          Every day, new types of malware are discovered. However, many of them
          are actually variants of existing malware â€” they share most of the
          code and there is a slight difference in configurations. In most
          cases, malware analysis begins with unpacking the malware to extract
          its configuration. Malconf is python3 library which extracts
          configurations from executable files .
