        Every day, new types of malware are discovered. However, many of them
        are actually variants of existing malware â€” they share most of the code
        and there is a slight difference in configurations. In most cases,
        malware analysis begins with unpacking the malware to extract its
        configuration. Malconf is python3 library which extracts configurations
        from executable files .
